        It would not be a stretch of imagination to say that indigenous practices — spiritual or non-spiritual — often embody an ecological ethic of conservation

        Prayagraj hosted more than 60 crore pilgrims and visitors over a span of 45 days during the Maha Kumbh, according to the estimates of the Uttar Pradesh government. The world has witnessed the religious and spiritual fervour that moved the entire nation while it celebrated its reverence for the river goddess Ganga. Yet, the event is fundamentally a manifestation of a profound and deep-seated river- society relationship. Cultural gatherings such as the Maha Kumbh are known to happen along rivers and water bodies. Can we leverage this relationship for the enduring rejuvenation of rivers and water bodies?
