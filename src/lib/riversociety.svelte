    Reading Rituals for Rejuvenating Rivers
  </h2>

  <p>
  The Mahakumbh 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, held at the sacred Sangam of three rivers—where the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati converge—drew more than 65 crore visitors over a span of 45 days, manifesting a profound spiritual bond with the river. The event underscores an immense cultural convening power, embedding ecological ethics within the religious practice, legends, and beliefs.
</p>
<br>
<p>The monumental gathering drove two contrasting narratives:</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Celebrating the societal and spiritual virtues of the Indian traditions that cherish nature</li>
  <li>Examining the environmental impacts of mass congregations during ritual practices that shear river ecologies</li>
</ul>

  <h3>UNPACKING <em>“AASTHA”</em> AS AN <em>“ASTRA”</em>
</h3>
  <p>
   We want to bring rituals and practices to the centre of analysis in thinking about rejuvenating rivers. The approach recognises the rituals and practices are informed and produced by an ecosystem where a variety of agents, actors, and networks actively participate. These range from priests, pandas, pandits to popular preachers and spiritual thought leaders, extending to the institutionalised versions, including ashrams, akharas, and other institutional forms. 

  </p>
  <br />
  
  <p>
    The political and economic interests are also a part of the ecosystem, transcending the spiritual or religious networks. Therefore, to make rejuvenating rivers a people’s programme, reimagining rituals must work with these networks and institutions.

  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Our research is driven by the following question:

  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Can we reimagine the rituals and practices for river rejuvenation? How can we redeploy the power relations towards river rejuvenation?
</strong>

          “We believe that taking a dip at the Prayagraj Sangam —the confluence
          of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mystical Saraswati, purifies our soul
          and liberates us from the bondages of life. A dip in the holy waters
          will wash away our sins in its flow, as we believe it allows us to be
          reborn. We are truly fortunate to have the opportunity to attend the
          Sangam and hope to continue this tradition in the future.”
