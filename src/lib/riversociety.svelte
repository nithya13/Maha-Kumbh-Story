      Chapter 1: Rituals and River-societies
    </h2>
    <!-- <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"></p> -->
    <p>
      The Maha Kumbh of 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, at the Triveni Sangam
      of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati gathered over 60 crore
      pilgrims and visitors over a span of 45 days. A spectacle embodying
      people’s spiritual connection with the river.
    </p>
    <p>A measure of the river’s cultural convening power.</p>
    <p>
      An ecological ethic deeply embedded in religious practices, legends, and
      beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This colossal event of Maha Kumbh has been subjected to two outwardly
      divergent narratives. One focused on society and spirituality: the virtues
      of the Indian spiritual traditions of respect and reverence towards
      nature. The other on the environmental concerns and sensibilities: how
      mass gatherings and the ritual practices impact river ecologies. These two
      appear conflicting, but we see powerful convergence for river
      rejuvenation. We believe it is possible if we focus on the river-society
      relationship embodying Maha Kumbh and similar gatherings along the rivers
      and explore beyond the binary views of the spiritual and the
      environmental. The river-society relationship is often described as Aastha
      (loosely translated from faith). Aastha is the most potent power
      mobilizing the masses of populations to come and express their deep
      reverence to the river Ganga (the Goddess) in the form of a variety of
      rituals and practices along the river. The primary goal of our research is
      to unpack and understand the Aastha and turn it into Astra for river
      rejuvenation. This is a pilot project initiated by the TREADS Initiative
      at CPR and supported by the NMCG, beginning with an audio-visual
      documentation of rituals at the Maha Kumbh of Prayagraj. We showcase the
      work carried out under this project on this website. Towards the above
      goal, our research is driven by the following questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the rituals and practices along the river? How do these impact
      the river ecologies?
    </p>
    <p>
      What/who informs, prescribes, and sanctions the rituals and practices -
      the spiritual consciousness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Embedded within these networks are complex power relations. At the apex
      are the Akharas and their heads (such as the Acharya Mahamandaleshwar),
      who hold significant spiritual and organizational authority. Influential
      gurus and socio-cultural organizations further shape the discourse and
      mobilize followers. The pandas and purohits act as intermediaries,
      directly engaging with pilgrims and facilitating ritual practices. At the
      grassroots are the pilgrims and Kalpavasis, whose participation and faith
      drive the scale and significance of the event. These layers of authority
      and influence interact with political and economic interests, creating a
      dynamic ecosystem where spiritual, social, and material powers converge
      and negotiate the meaning and practice of rituals along the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we unpack and understand the ecological ethic, if any, underlying the
      spiritual consciousness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we reimagine the rituals and practices for river rejuvenation? How can
      we redeploy the power relations towards river rejuvenation?
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we pursue Rejuvenating Rivers as a people’s programme, where
      people’s engagement in the river-society intersectional spaces contribute
      to improving rivers’ ecological status? We want to bring rituals and
      practices to the centre of analysis in thinking about rejuvenating rivers.
      The approach recognizes that the rituals and practices are informed and
      produced by an ecosystem where a variety of agents, actors, and networks
      actively participate. These range from priests, pandas, pandits to popular
      preachers and spiritual thought-leaders - extending to the
      institutionalized versions including ashrams, akharas, and other
      institutional forms. Political and economic interests too are part of the
      ecosystem, transcending the spiritual or religious networks. Reimagining
      rituals must work with these networks and institutions towards making
      rejuvenating rivers a truly people’s programme. India’s rivers and water
      bodies are often hosts to gatherings and events of cultural and spiritual
      significance. These are not restricted to Kumbh gatherings alone but
      extend to other festivals such as the Chhath Puja. It is time for bringing
      this cultural confluence with river ecologies to the centre of analysis
      for an Indian model of river rejuvenation and water conservation.
