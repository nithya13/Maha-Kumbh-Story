    Reading Rituals for Rejuvenating Rivers
  </h2>

  <p>
    The Maha Kumbh of 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, at the Triveni Sangam of
    the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati gathered over 60 crore
    pilgrims and visitors over a span of 45 days.
  </p>
  <p>A spectacle embodying people’s spiritual connection with the river.</p>
  <p>A measure of the river’s cultural convening power.</p>
  <p>
    An ecological ethic deeply embedded in religious practices, legends, and
    beliefs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This colossal event of Maha Kumbh has been subjected to two outwardly
    divergent narratives. One focused on society and spirituality: the virtues
    of the Indian spiritual traditions of respect and reverence towards nature.
    The other on the environmental concerns and sensibilities: how mass
    gatherings and the ritual practices impact river ecologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    These two appear conflicting, but we see powerful convergence for river
    rejuvenation. We believe it is possible if we focus on the river-society
    relationship embodying Maha Kumbh and similar gatherings along the rivers
    and explore beyond the binary views of the spiritual and the environmental.
  </p>
  <p>
    The river-society relationship is often described as <em>Aastha</em>
    (loosely translated from faith). <em>Aastha</em> is the most potent power mobilizing
    the masses of populations to come and express their deep reverence to the river
    Ganga (the Goddess) in the form of a variety of rituals and practices along the
    river.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary goal of our research is to unpack and understand the <em
      >Aastha</em
    > and turn it into Astra for river rejuvenation. This is a pilot project initiated
    by the TREADS Initiative at CPR and supported by the NMCG, beginning with an
    audio-visual documentation of rituals at the Maha Kumbh of Prayagraj. We showcase
    the work carried out under this project on this website.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>Focus of Our Inquiry</h3>
  <p>
    Towards the above goal, our research is driven by the following questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    What are the rituals and practices along the river? How do these impact the
    river ecologies?
  </p>
  <p>
    What/who informs, prescribes, and sanctions the rituals and practices - the
    spiritual consciousness? Who are the agents, institutions, and networks?
    What are the embedded power relations?
  </p>
  <p>
    Can we unpack and understand the ecological ethic, if any, underlying the
    spiritual consciousness?
  </p>
  <p>
    Can we reimagine the rituals and practices for river rejuvenation? How can
    we redeploy the power relations towards river rejuvenation?
  </p>
  <p>
    How can we pursue Rejuvenating Rivers as a people’s programme, where
    people’s engagement in the river-society intersectional spaces contribute to
    improving rivers’ ecological status?
  </p>
  <p>
    We want to bring rituals and practices to the centre of analysis in thinking
    about rejuvenating rivers. The approach recognizes that the rituals and
    practices are informed and produced by an ecosystem where a variety of
    agents, actors, and networks actively participate. These range from priests,
    pandas, pandits to popular preachers and spiritual thought-leaders -
    extending to the institutionalized versions including ashrams, akharas, and
    other institutional forms. Political and economic interests too are part of
    the ecosystem, transcending the spiritual or religious networks. Reimagining
    rituals must work with these networks and institutions towards making
    rejuvenating rivers a truly people’s programme.
  </p>
  <p>
    India’s rivers and water bodies are often hosts to gatherings and events of
    cultural and spiritual significance. These are not restricted to Kumbh
    gatherings alone but extend to other festivals such as the Chhath Puja. It
    is time for bringing this cultural confluence with river ecologies to the
    centre of analysis for an Indian model of river rejuvenation and water
    conservation.

          “We believe that taking a dip at the Prayagraj Sangam —the confluence
          of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mystical Saraswati, purifies our soul
          and liberates us from the bondages of life. A dip in the holy waters
          will wash away our sins in its flow, as we believe it allows us to be
          reborn. We are truly fortunate to have the opportunity to attend the
          Sangam and hope to continue this tradition in the future.”
